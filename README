The Software Toolboxes are libraries of open source classes developed in multiple programming languages.


Libraries of open source classes:

  OpenCpp - C++ classes

  OpenJava - Java classes

  OpenOctave - Octave/Matlab function

  OpenPerl - PERL scripts and class

  OpenPython - Python classes

  OpenRuby - Ruby classes

  OpenScala - Scala classes


Core Software Classes

  Text File Classes:
 
    InputFile - class for working with reading text from a file.

    OuputFile - class for working with writing text to a file.


  Bioinformatics classes:

    FastaSequence - class representing a FASTA sequence.

    FastaIterator - iterator class for reading FASTA sequences from a FASTA file.



Additional classes:

  OpenPerl

    lengths.pl - script to determine the lengths of sequences in a FASTA file.

    Motifs.pl - script for finding Prosite motif patterns in a FASTA file of protein sequences.
